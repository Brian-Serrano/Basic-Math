<p>Here are some basic properties of probabilities:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Probability Range: The probability of any event E is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. A probability of 0 indicates that the event is impossible, while a probability of 1 means the event is certain to occur.</p>
        <p>Example: The probability of rolling a number greater than 7 on a standard six-sided die is 0 because it is impossible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Complement Rule: The probability of the complement of an event E (denoted as E') is equal to 1 minus the probability of E.</p>
        <p>Example: If the probability of event A is 0.6, then the probability of event A not occurring (A') is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Addition Rule: For any two events A and B, the probability of either event A or event B occurring (denoted as A or B) is the sum of their individual probabilities, minus the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (denoted as A and B).</p>
        <p>Example: Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The probability of rolling an even number (event A) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = 0.5, and the probability of rolling a number less than 4 (event B) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = 0.5. The probability of rolling either an even number or a number less than 4 is 0.5 + 0.5 - <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Multiplication Rule for Independent Events: For any two independent events A and B, the probability of both events occurring (denoted as A and B) is the product of their individual probabilities.</p>
        <p>Example: Consider flipping a fair coin twice. The probability of getting heads on the first flip (event A) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>, and the probability of getting heads on the second flip (event B) is also <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>. The probability of getting heads on both flips is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> * <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events: For two dependent events A and B, the probability of both events occurring (denoted as A and B) is the product of the probability of event A and the conditional probability of event B given that A has already occurred.</p>
        <p>Example: Consider drawing a card from a standard deck without replacement. The probability of drawing a red card on the first draw (event A) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">26</span><span class="denominator">52</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>. If a red card is drawn on the first draw, the probability of drawing another red card on the second draw (event B) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">51</span></span></span>. The probability of drawing two red cards in a row is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> * <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">51</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">102</span></span></span>.</p>
    </li>

<p>These properties help us understand and calculate probabilities in various situations. They are fundamental in probability theory and provide a basis for more advanced concepts and calculations.</p>
