<p>The PEMDAS rule is an acronym that stands for the order of operations in mathematics. It is used to determine the sequence in which different operations should be performed when evaluating an expression. PEMDAS stands for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>P - Parentheses (or Brackets)</li>
    <li>E - Exponents (or Powers and Roots)</li>
    <li>M - Multiplication</li>
    <li>D - Division</li>
    <li>A - Addition</li>
    <li>S - Subtraction</li>
</ul>
<p>The rule establishes a hierarchy of operations, ensuring that calculations are performed in a consistent and unambiguous manner.</p>
<p>Let's go through some examples to illustrate how the PEMDAS rule works:</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate the expression: 4 + 3 x 2</li>
</ul>
<p>According to PEMDAS, we first perform multiplication and then addition. So, we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, and then add 4 to get the final result:</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 + 3 x 2 = 4 + 6 = 10</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate the expression: 6 ÷ 2 + 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, following PEMDAS, we perform division first and then addition:</p>
<ul>
    <li>6 ÷ 2 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 3:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate the expression: 3 x (4 + 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we have parentheses, which take precedence over other operations. We evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3 x (4 + 2) = 3 x 6 = 18</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 4:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate the expression: 2 + 3 x (4 - 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>We follow the order of operations from left to right:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, we perform the subtraction inside the parentheses: 4 - 1 = 3</li>
    <li>Then, we multiply 3 by 3: 3 x 3 = 9</li>
    <li>Finally, we add 2 to 9: 2 + 9 = 11</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 5:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate the expression: 4² - 2 x 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we have an exponent and multiplication:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, we square 4: 4² = 16</li>
    <li>Then, we multiply 2 by 5: 2 x 5 = 10</li>
    <li>Finally, we subtract 10 from 16: 16 - 10 = 6</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples demonstrate the importance of following the PEMDAS rule to maintain consistency in mathematical calculations and ensure accurate results. By understanding and applying the order of operations, you can correctly evaluate complex expressions.</p>
