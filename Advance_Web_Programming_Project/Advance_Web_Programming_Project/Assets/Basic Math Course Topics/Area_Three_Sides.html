<p>The area of a three-sided shape is a measure of the region enclosed by its three sides. The formulas to find the area of different three-sided shapes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Right Triangle:</p>
        <p>A right triangle is a triangle with one 90-degree angle. To find the area of a right triangle, you multiply the lengths of the two perpendicular sides (legs) and divide the result by 2.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a right triangle = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">base * height</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's say we have a right triangle with a base of 4 units and a height of 6 units. The area of this right triangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4 * 6</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">24</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = 12 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the right triangle is 12 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Equilateral Triangle:</p>
        <p>An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all sides of equal length. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, you can use the formula based on the side length.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of an equilateral triangle = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">side length<sup>2</sup> * √3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider an equilateral triangle with a side length of 5 units. The area of this equilateral triangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">5<sup>2</sup> * √3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> ≈ 10.825 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the equilateral triangle is approximately 10.825 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Isosceles or Scalene Triangle:</p>
        <p>An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two sides of equal length, while a scalene triangle has no equal sides. To find the area of an isosceles or scalene triangle, you can use the formula based on the base and height.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of an isosceles or scalene triangle = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">base * height</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have an isosceles or scalene triangle with a base of 8 units and a height of 5 units. The area of this triangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">8 * 5</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">40</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = 20 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the isosceles or scalene triangle is 20 square units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the area of three-sided shapes such as a right triangle, equilateral triangle, and isosceles or scalene triangle. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
