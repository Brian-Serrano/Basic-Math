<p>In mathematics, there are six fundamental operations used to manipulate sets. These operations allow us to perform various set operations and combine or modify sets. Let's discuss each operation with examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Union:</p>
        <p>The union of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set that contains all the elements that are in either set A or set B, or in both.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>A = {1, 2, 3}</p>
        <p>B = {3, 4, 5}</p>
        <p>A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Intersection:</p>
        <p>The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set that contains all the elements that are common to both set A and set B.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>A = {1, 2, 3}</p>
        <p>B = {3, 4, 5}</p>
        <p>A ∩ B = {3}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Set Difference:</p>
        <p>The set difference of two sets A and B, denoted by A - B or A \ B, is the set that contains all the elements that are in set A but not in set B.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>A = {1, 2, 3, 4}</p>
        <p>B = {3, 4, 5}</p>
        <p>A - B = {1, 2}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Complement:</p>
        <p>The complement of a set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in set A.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
        <p>A = {3, 4}</p>
        <p>A' = {1, 2, 5}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Cartesian Product:</p>
        <p>The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from set A and b is from set B.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>A = {1, 2}</p>
        <p>B = {3, 4}</p>
        <p>A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Power Set:</p>
        <p>The power set of a set A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set itself.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>A = {1, 2}</p>
        <p>P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These six operations allow us to perform various operations on sets and manipulate their elements. They are fundamental tools in set theory and have applications in many areas of mathematics and beyond.</p>
