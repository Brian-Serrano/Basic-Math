<p>Factoring quadratic expressions in algebra involves expressing a quadratic polynomial as a product of two binomial factors. This process helps in solving quadratic equations, simplifying expressions, and understanding the behavior of quadratic functions. Here's how you can factor quadratic expressions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Write the quadratic expression in the form: ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c, where a, b, and c are coefficients.</li>
    <li>
        Look for common factors, if any.
        <ul>
            <li>Check if there is a common factor among all the terms. If so, factor it out first.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the factors of the quadratic term.
        <ul>
            <li>Find two numbers whose product is equal to a * c (the product of the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> and the constant term c), and whose sum is equal to b (the coefficient of x).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Write the quadratic expression as a product of binomial factors.
        <ul>
            <li>Use the factors determined in the previous step to write the quadratic expression as (dx + e)(fx + g), where d, e, f, and g are coefficients.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Factor the quadratic expression x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 6.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: The expression is already in the required form: x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 6.</li>
    <li>Step 2: There are no common factors among the terms.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Determine the factors of 6: The factors of 6 are 1 and 6, or 2 and 3.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Write the quadratic expression as a product of binomial factors using the factors found:
        <ul>
            <li>(x + 2)(x + 3)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The factored form of the quadratic expression x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 6 is (x + 2)(x + 3).</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Factor the quadratic expression 2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 3.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: The expression is already in the required form: 2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 3.</li>
    <li>Step 2: There are no common factors among the terms.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Determine the factors of -6 (the product of 2 and -3): The factors of -6 are -1 and 6, or 1 and -6, or -2 and 3, or 2 and -3.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Write the quadratic expression as a product of binomial factors using the factors found:
        <ul>
            <li>(2x + 1)(x - 3)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The factored form of the quadratic expression 2x<sup>2</sup> - 7x - 3 is (2x + 1)(x - 3).</p>
<p>Factoring quadratic expressions allows us to understand the roots, intercepts, and factors of quadratic equations, making them easier to solve and analyze. It is an essential technique in algebra and has various applications in mathematics and real-world problem-solving.</p>
