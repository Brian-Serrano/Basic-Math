<p>Addition is a fundamental arithmetic operation in mathematics that involves combining two or more numbers to find their sum. The symbol used to represent addition is "+".</p>
<p>To perform addition, you simply need to add the numbers together, following the basic rules of arithmetic. For example, to add 2 and 3, you would write:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 + 3 = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more examples of addition:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 + 2 = 3</li>
    <li>4 + 6 = 10</li>
    <li>8 + 9 = 17</li>
    <li>12 + 5 = 17</li>
    <li>25 + 33 = 58</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can also add negative numbers. When adding a positive number and a negative number, you need to subtract the absolute value of the negative number from the positive number. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5 + (-3) = 2</li>
    <li>10 + (-7) = 3</li>
    <li>(-2) + 8 = 6</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can also add fractions and decimals. When adding fractions, you need to find a common denominator before adding the numerators. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> + <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span></li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">8</span></span></span> + <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="denominator">8</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">8</span><span class="denominator">8</span></span></span> = 1</li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> + <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>When adding decimals, you need to line up the decimal points and then add the numbers as you normally would. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.2 + 3.4 = 4.6</li>
    <li>0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75</li>
    <li>12.3 + 4.56 = 16.86</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of addition in math. It's a simple operation, but it's used in many different contexts, from basic arithmetic to complex mathematical equations.</p>
