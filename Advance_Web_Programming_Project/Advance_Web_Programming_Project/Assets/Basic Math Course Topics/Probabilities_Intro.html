<p>Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of uncertainty and the likelihood of events occurring. It provides a framework for quantifying and analyzing the likelihood of different outcomes in various situations. Probability is used extensively in fields such as statistics, economics, finance, physics, and computer science, among others.</p>
<p>Key Concepts in Probability:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Experiment: An experiment refers to a process or event that results in one or more outcomes. For example, tossing a coin, rolling a dice, or conducting a survey can be considered experiments.</li>
    <li>Sample Space: The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, the sample space for a coin toss experiment consists of two outcomes: heads and tails.</li>
    <li>Event: An event is a specific outcome or a set of outcomes of an experiment. Events can be simple (a single outcome) or compound (a combination of outcomes). For example, in a dice roll experiment, an event could be rolling an even number.</li>
    <li>Probability: Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. Probabilities can be expressed as fractions, decimals, or percentages.</li>

        Basic Probability Rules:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The Probability of an Event: The probability of an event A is denoted as P(A) and is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.</li>
            <li>Complementary Events: The probability of an event A not occurring (denoted as A') is equal to 1 minus the probability of event A.</li>
            <li>Addition Rule: The probability of either event A or event B occurring (denoted as A or B) is the sum of their individual probabilities, minus the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (denoted as A and B).</li>
            <li>Multiplication Rule: The probability of both event A and event B occurring (denoted as A and B) is the product of their individual probabilities if the events are independent.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Independent and Dependent Events: Two events are considered independent if the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event. In contrast, dependent events are influenced by the occurrence or non-occurrence of other events.</li>
    <li>Conditional Probability: Conditional probability measures the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as P(A|B), where A and B are events.</li>
</ol>
<p>Probability theory provides a systematic framework for understanding uncertainty, making predictions, and analyzing data. It plays a crucial role in decision-making, risk assessment, and statistical analysis.</p>
