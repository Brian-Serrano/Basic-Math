<p>Division is a fundamental arithmetic operation in mathematics that involves separating a quantity into equal parts or finding out how many times one number is contained in another. The symbol used to represent division is "÷" or "/".</p>
<p>To perform division, you divide one number (the dividend) by another number (the divisor) to find the quotient. For example, to divide 10 by 2, you would write:</p>
<ul>
    <li>10 ÷ 2 = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more examples of division:</p>
<ul>
    <li>15 ÷ 3 = 5</li>
    <li>24 ÷ 6 = 4</li>
    <li>8 ÷ 4 = 2</li>
    <li>12 ÷ 3 = 4</li>
    <li>20 ÷ 5 = 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Division can also involve remainders. When the division is not exact, the remainder is the amount left over. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1</li>
    <li>10 ÷ 3 = 3 remainder 1</li>
    <li>17 ÷ 4 = 4 remainder 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Division can also be used to calculate the average of a set of numbers. To find the average, you divide the sum of the numbers by the count of numbers. For example, if you have a set of numbers 4, 6, and 8, the average is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>(4 + 6 + 8) ÷ 3 = 18 ÷ 3 = 6</li>
</ul>
<p>When dividing fractions, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal (flipped version) of the second fraction. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> ÷ <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> x <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span></li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> ÷ <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> x <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">1</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">8</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>When dividing decimals, you move the decimal point in the divisor and dividend to the right until the divisor becomes a whole number. Then, you perform the division as you would with whole numbers and adjust the decimal point in the quotient. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.2 ÷ 0.6 = 12 ÷ 6 = 2</li>
    <li>0.75 ÷ 0.25 = 75 ÷ 25 = 3</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of division in math. It is a crucial operation that is used in various mathematical contexts, such as dividing quantities into equal parts, calculating rates, solving equations, and finding averages.</p>
