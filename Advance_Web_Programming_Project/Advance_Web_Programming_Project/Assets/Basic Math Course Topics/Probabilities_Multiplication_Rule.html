<p>The multiplication rule of probabilities applies to both dependent events and independent events. Let's discuss each case and provide examples for both scenarios:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Independent Events:</p>
        <p>Independent events are events where the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event. If events A and B are independent, the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (P(A and B)) is the product of their individual probabilities.</p>
        <p>The multiplication rule for independent events is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider flipping a fair coin twice. Let event A be getting heads on the first flip, and event B be getting tails on the second flip. These events are independent since the outcome of the first flip does not influence the outcome of the second flip. The probability of getting heads on the first flip (P(A)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>, and the probability of getting tails on the second flip (P(B)) is also <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>.</p>
        <p>Using the multiplication rule for independent events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)</li>
            <li>P(A and B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> * <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span></li>
            <li>P(A and B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the probability of getting heads on the first flip and tails on the second flip when flipping a fair coin twice is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Dependent Events:</p>
        <p>Dependent events are events where the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event affects the occurrence of the other event. If events A and B are dependent, the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (P(A and B)) is the product of the probability of event A and the conditional probability of event B given that A has already occurred (P(B|A)).</p>
        <p>The multiplication rule for dependent events is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider drawing cards from a standard deck without replacement. Let event A be drawing a red card on the first draw, and event B be drawing a red card on the second draw. These events are dependent because the outcome of the first draw affects the composition of the deck for the second draw. The probability of drawing a red card on the first draw (P(A)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">26</span><span class="denominator">52</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>. If a red card is drawn on the first draw, the probability of drawing another red card on the second draw (P(B|A)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">51</span></span></span>.</p>
        <p>Using the multiplication rule for dependent events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)</li>
            <li>P(A and B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> * <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">51</span></span></span></li>
            <li>P(A and B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">102</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the probability of drawing two red cards in a row from a standard deck without replacement is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">102</span></span></span>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These examples illustrate how the multiplication rule of probabilities is applied to both dependent events and independent events, taking into account the nature of the events and their relationship to each other.</p>
