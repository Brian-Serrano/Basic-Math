<p>The Difference of Squares is a special factoring pattern in algebra that occurs when we have the difference between two perfect squares. It allows us to factorize an expression into the product of two binomials. The general form of the Difference of Squares is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)(a - b)</li>
</ul>
<p>where 'a' and 'b' can be any real numbers or algebraic expressions. Here's how you can use the Difference of Squares pattern:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identify the expression in the form a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>.</li>
    <li>Express the expression as the product of two binomials:
        <ul>
            <li>The first binomial is the sum of the square root of the first term and the square root of the second term.</li>
            <li>The second binomial is the difference between the square root of the first term and the square root of the second term.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Simplify the binomials if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at a couple of examples:</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Factor the expression x<sup>2</sup> - 16.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Identify the expression as a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>, where a = x and b = 4.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Apply the Difference of Squares pattern:</li>
    <li>x<sup>2</sup> - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the expression x<sup>2</sup> - 16 can be factored as (x + 4)(x - 4) using the Difference of Squares pattern.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Factor the expression 9y<sup>2</sup> - 4.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Identify the expression as a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>, where a = 3y and b = 2.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Apply the Difference of Squares pattern:</li>
    <li>9y<sup>2</sup> - 4 = (3y + 2)(3y - 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the expression 9y<sup>2</sup> - 4 can be factored as (3y + 2)(3y - 2) using the Difference of Squares pattern.</p>
<p>The Difference of Squares pattern is a useful tool for factoring expressions and simplifying algebraic equations. By recognizing this pattern, we can quickly factorize certain expressions, making them easier to work with and solve.</p>
