<p>In statistics, the binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. Each trial in the binomial distribution can result in one of two outcomes, typically labeled as "success" or "failure." The distribution is characterized by two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p) in each trial.</p>
<p>The probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution is given by the formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p<sup>k</sup> * (1 - p)<sup>(n - k)</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials,</li>
    <li>C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient (n choose k), which represents the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials,</li>
    <li>p is the probability of success in each trial, and</li>
    <li>(1 - p) is the probability of failure in each trial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of examples that illustrate the binomial distribution:</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>A fair coin is tossed 10 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?</p>
<p>Here, n = 10 (number of trials) and p = 0.5 (probability of getting a head in each trial). We want to calculate P(X = 3), where X follows a binomial distribution.</p>
<ul>
    <li>P(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * (0.5)<sup>3</sup> * (1 - 0.5)<sup>(10 - 3)</sup></li>
    <li>= 120 * 0.125 * 0.5<sup>7</sup></li>
    <li>≈ 0.1172</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 10 coin tosses is approximately 0.1172.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>In a multiple-choice exam, each question has 4 options. A student guesses on all 10 questions. What is the probability of getting at least 8 correct answers?</p>
<p>Here, n = 10 (number of trials) and p = 0.25 (probability of guessing the correct answer in each trial). We want to calculate P(X ≥ 8).</p>
<ul>
    <li>P(X ≥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)</li>
    <li>= C(10, 8) * (0.25)<sup>8</sup> * (1 - 0.25)<sup>(10 - 8)</sup> + C(10, 9) * (0.25)<sup>9</sup> * (1 - 0.25)<sup>(10 - 9)</sup> + C(10, 10) * (0.25)<sup>10</sup> * (1 - 0.25)<sup>(10 - 10)</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>You can compute these probabilities using the binomial formula and add them up to find the result.</p>
<p>The binomial distribution is widely used in various fields, such as quality control, genetics, and finance, to model and analyze binary outcomes with a fixed number of trials.</p>
