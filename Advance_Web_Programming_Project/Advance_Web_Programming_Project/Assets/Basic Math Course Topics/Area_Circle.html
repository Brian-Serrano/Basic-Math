<p>In mathematics, the area of a circle refers to the measure of the region enclosed by the circle. The area of a circle can be found using the formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A = πr<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A represents the area of the circle,</li>
    <li>π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and</li>
    <li>r is the radius of the circle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example that illustrates finding the area of a circle:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Let's say we have a circle with a radius of 7 centimeters. To find the area of this circle, we can use the formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A = πr<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Substituting the given value, we have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A = 3.14159 * 7<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>= 3.14159 * 49</li>
    <li>≈ 153.938 square centimeters</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the area of the circle with a radius of 7 centimeters is approximately 153.938 square centimeters.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of its radius. Doubling the radius will result in quadrupling the area. Similarly, if you know the diameter of the circle (which is twice the radius), you can use the formula A = π(d/2)<sup>2</sup> to find the area.</p>
<p>The area of a circle is a fundamental concept in geometry and is used in various calculations and applications, such as finding the area of circular fields, calculating the surface area of cylindrical objects, and solving problems related to circles and curved shapes.</p>
