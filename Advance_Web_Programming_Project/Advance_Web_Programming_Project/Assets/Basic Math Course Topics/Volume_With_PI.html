<p>Let's discuss finding the volume of a cylinder, sphere, and cone, and provide examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Cylinder:</p>
        <p>A cylinder is a three-dimensional shape with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface. To find the volume of a cylinder, you can use the formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume of a cylinder = π * radius<sup>2</sup> * height</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a cylinder with a radius of 3 units and a height of 8 units. The volume of this cylinder would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume = π * 3<sup>2</sup> * 8 = 72π cubic units (approximately 226.195 cubic units)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 72π cubic units or 226.195 cubic units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Sphere:</p>
        <p>A sphere is a three-dimensional shape with all points on its surface equidistant from its center. To find the volume of a sphere, you can use the formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume of a sphere = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> * π * radius<sup>3</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a sphere with a radius of 5 units. The volume of this sphere would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> * π * 5<sup>3</sup> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> * π * 125 = 500π cubic units (approximately 1570.796 cubic units)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the volume of the sphere is approximately 500π cubic units or 1570.796 cubic units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Cone:</p>
        <p>A cone is a three-dimensional shape with a circular base and a pointed top. To find the volume of a cone, you can use the formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume of a cone = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> * π * radius<sup>2</sup> * height</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a cone with a radius of 4 units and a height of 6 units. The volume of this cone would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> * π * 4<sup>2</sup> * 6 = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> * π * 16 * 6 = 32π cubic units (approximately 100.531 cubic units)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the volume of the cone is approximately 32π cubic units or 100.531 cubic units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the volume of three-dimensional shapes such as a cylinder, sphere, and cone. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
