<p>Let's discuss finding the volume of a cube, rectangular prism, and pyramid, and provide examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Cube:</p>
        <p>A cube is a three-dimensional shape with six equal square faces. To find the volume of a cube, you can use the formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume of a cube = side length<sup>3</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a cube with a side length of 5 units. The volume of this cube would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume = 5<sup>3</sup> = 125 cubic units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the volume of the cube is 125 cubic units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Rectangular Prism:</p>
        <p>A rectangular prism, also known as a rectangular cuboid, is a three-dimensional shape with six rectangular faces. To find the volume of a rectangular prism, you can use the formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume of a rectangular prism = length * width * height</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a rectangular prism with a length of 8 units, a width of 6 units, and a height of 4 units. The volume of this rectangular prism would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume = 8 * 6 * 4 = 192 cubic units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the volume of the rectangular prism is 192 cubic units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Pyramid:</p>
        <p>A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape with a polygonal base and triangular faces converging to a single point called the apex. To find the volume of a pyramid, you can use the formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume of a pyramid = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">base area * height</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a pyramid with a base area of 36 square units and a height of 10 units. The volume of this pyramid would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">36 * 10</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> = 120 cubic units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the volume of the pyramid is 120 cubic units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the volume of three-dimensional shapes such as a cube, rectangular prism, and pyramid. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
