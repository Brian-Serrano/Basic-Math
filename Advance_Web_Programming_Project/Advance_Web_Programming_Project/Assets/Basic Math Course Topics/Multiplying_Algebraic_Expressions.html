<h4>Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions</h4>
<p>Multiplication of algebraic expressions can be performed on algebraic expressions in the same way as it can be performed on two whole numbers or fractions. Multiplication of two algebraic expressions or variable expressions involves multiplying two expressions that are combined with arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and contain constants, variables, terms, and coefficients. In this article, let us learn about the rules of multiplication of algebraic expressions with solved examples.</p>
<h4>What is Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions?</h4>
<p>Multiplication of algebraic expressions involves the following steps. Multiply the coefficients of the terms, add the powers of the variables with the same base, and obtain the algebraic sum of the like and unlike terms. Before learning about the multiplication of algebraic expressions, let's see some of the algebraic rules for multiplication.</p>
<p>(i) The product of two terms with the same signs is positive, and the product of two terms with different signs is negative.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>-a × - b = ab</li>
    <li>a × - b = -ab</li>
</ul>
<p>(ii) We can add the exponents of the same bases in case of multiplication as a<sup>m</sup> × a<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>m+n</sup></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a<sup>2</sup> × a<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>+3 = a<sup>5</sup></li>
    <li>b<sup>5</sup> × b<sup>8</sup> = b<sup>5</sup>+8 = b<sup>13</sup></li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions Formulas</h4>
<p>We use different algebraic identities for the multiplication of algebraic expressions to make the complex problem simple. The below-given image shows some of the helpful formulas and expansions to remember while performing multiplication of algebraic expressions:</p>
<h4>How To Do Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions?</h4>
<p>The result of the multiplication of algebraic expressions is obtained by multiplying each term of the polynomial by the other and then taking the algebraic sum of these products. There are different types of multiplication of algebraic expressions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Monomial by monomial/binomial</li>
    <li>Binomial by Binomial</li>
    <li>Polynomial by monomial/binomial</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, we multiply each term of the first polynomial with each term of the second. Let us discuss them case by case.</p>
<h4>Multiplication of Two Monomials</h4>
<p>An algebraic expression is considered a monomial when it only contains one term like 5ab. Monomials usually include variables, numbers, or multiple numbers and/or variables that are multiplied together.</p>
<p>Product of two monomials = numerical coefficients × variable parts</p>
<p>Example: Find the product of 6ab and -3a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
    <li>6ab × -3a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>3</sup></li>
    <li>= 6 × -3 × ab × a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>3</sup></li>
    <li>= -18 × a<sup>1</sup>+2 × b<sup>1</sup>+3</li>
    <li>= -18a<sup>3</sup>b<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiplication of a Polynomial by a Monomial</h4>
<p>An algebraic expression is considered a polynomial when it contains variables, coefficients, that involve only the operations of subtraction, addition, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables.</p>
<p>Multiply each term of the polynomial by the monomial, using the distributive law: a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c</p>
<p>Example: Find following product: 5a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> × (3a<sup>2</sup> - 4ab + 6b<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
    <li>5a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup> × (3a<sup>2</sup> - 4ab + 6b<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    <li>= (5a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>) × (3a<sup>2</sup>) + (5a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>) × (- 4ab) + (5a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>) × (6b<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    <li>= 15a<sup>4</sup>b<sup>2</sup> - 20a<sup>3</sup>b<sup>3</sup> + 30a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiplication of Two Binomials</h4>
<p>An algebraic expression is considered binomial when it is made of the sum or difference of two terms. We multiply two binomials by using the distributive law of multiplication twice.</p>
<p>Let us find the product of two binomials (a + b) and (c + d).</p>
<ul>
    <li>(a + b) × (c + d)</li>
    <li>= a × (c + d) + b × (c + d)</li>
    <li>= a × c + a × d + b × c + b × d</li>
    <li>= ac + ad + bc + bd</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This method is known as the horizontal multiplication method.</p>
<p>Example: Multiply (3a + 5b) and (5a - 7b).</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>(I) Horizontal multiplication method</p>
<ul>
    <li>(3a + 5b) × (5a - 7b)</li>
    <li>= 3a × (5a - 7b) + 5b × (5a - 7b)</li>
    <li>= (3a × 5a - 3a × 7b) + (5b × 5a - 5b × 7b)</li>
    <li>= (15a<sup>2</sup> - 21ab) + (25ab - 35b<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    <li>= 15a<sup>2</sup> - 21ab + 25ab - 35b<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>= 15a<sup>2</sup> + 4ab - 35b<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>(II) Column wise multiplication</p>
<ul>
    <li>3x + 5y</li>
    <li>x(5x - 7y)</li>
    <li>15x<sup>2</sup> + 25xy ⇐ multiplication by 5x.</li>
    <li>-21xy - 35y<sup>2</sup> ⇐ multiplication by -7y.</li>
    <li>15x<sup>2</sup> + 4xy - 35y<sup>2</sup> ⇐ Added the above terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>IV. Multiplication by Polynomial</h4>
<p>Example: Multiply (5x<sup>2</sup> – 6x + 9) with (2x -3)</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
    <li>5x<sup>2</sup> - 6x + 9</li>
    <li>x(2x - 3)</li>
    <li>10x<sup>3</sup> - 12x<sup>2</sup> + 18x ⇐ multiplication by 2x.</li>
    <li>-15x<sup>2</sup> + 18x - 27 ⇐ multiplication by -3</li>
    <li>10x<sup>3</sup> - 27x<sup>2</sup> + 36x - 27 ⇐ Added the above terms.</li>
    <li>Therefore (5x<sup>2</sup> – 6x + 9) × (2x - 3) is (10x<sup>3</sup> – 27x<sup>2</sup> + 36x – 27)</li>
</ul>
