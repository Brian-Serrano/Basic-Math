<p>Factoring by grouping is a technique used in algebra to factorize expressions with four or more terms by grouping them into pairs. This method is particularly useful when there is a common factor in each pair. Here's how you can use the factoring by grouping method:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Group the terms in the expression into pairs.
        <ul>
            <li>Look for pairs of terms that have a common factor.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Factor out the common factor from each pair.
        <ul>
            <li>For each pair, factor out the greatest common factor of the terms in the pair.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Look for a common factor in the resulting binomials.
        <ul>
            <li>Look for a common factor between the binomials obtained from step 2.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Factor out the common factor from the binomials.
        <ul>
            <li>Factor out the greatest common factor of the binomials.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at an example:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Factor the expression 3ab + 6a - 4b - 8.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Step 1: Group the terms into pairs.</p>
        <p>(3ab + 6a) - (4b + 8)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Step 2: Factor out the common factor from each pair.</p>
        <p>3a(b + 2) - 4(b + 2)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Step 3: Look for a common factor in the resulting binomials.</p>
        <p>Notice that (b + 2) is a common factor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Step 4: Factor out the common factor from the binomials.</p>
        <p>(b + 2)(3a - 4)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>So, the expression 3ab + 6a - 4b - 8 can be factored as (b + 2)(3a - 4) using the factoring by grouping method.</p>
<p>Factoring by grouping is a useful technique when dealing with expressions with multiple terms. It allows us to simplify and factorize expressions, making them easier to work with and solve.</p>
