<p>The perimeter of a three-sided shape is the total length of its three sides. The formulas to find the perimeter of different three-sided shapes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Right Triangle:</p>
        <p>A right triangle is a triangle with one 90-degree angle. To find the perimeter of a right triangle, you add the lengths of all three sides.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a right triangle = side A + side B + hypotenuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's say we have a right triangle with side lengths of 3 units, 4 units, and 5 units. The perimeter of this right triangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the right triangle is 12 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Equilateral Triangle:</p>
        <p>An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all sides of equal length. To find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, you simply multiply the length of one side by 3.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 * side length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider an equilateral triangle with a side length of 6 units. The perimeter of this equilateral triangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 3 * 6 = 18 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 18 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Isosceles or Scalene Triangle:</p>
        <p>An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two sides of equal length, while a scalene triangle has no equal sides. To find the perimeter of an isosceles or scalene triangle, you add the lengths of all three sides.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of an isosceles or scalene triangle = side A + side B + side C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have an isosceles or scalene triangle with side lengths of 5 units, 7 units, and 6 units. The perimeter of this triangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 5 + 7 + 6 = 18 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the isosceles or scalene triangle is 18 units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the perimeter of three-sided shapes such as a right triangle, equilateral triangle, and isosceles or scalene triangle. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
