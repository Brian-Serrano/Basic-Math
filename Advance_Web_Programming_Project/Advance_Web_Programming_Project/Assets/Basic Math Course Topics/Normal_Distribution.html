<p>In statistics, the normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve, is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used to model a wide range of natural phenomena. It is symmetric and bell-shaped, with its shape determined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation controls the spread or variability of the data.</p>
<p>The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by the formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>f(x) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">σ * √(2π)</span></span></span> * e<sup><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">-(x - μ)<sup>2</sup></span><span class="denominator">2σ<sup>2</sup></span></span></span></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>f(x) is the probability density function at a given value x,</li>
    <li>μ is the mean of the distribution,</li>
    <li>σ is the standard deviation of the distribution,</li>
    <li>π is a mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159), and</li>
    <li>e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of examples that illustrate the normal distribution:</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>The heights of adult males in a population are normally distributed with a mean of 175 cm and a standard deviation of 6 cm. What is the probability of a randomly selected adult male being between 170 cm and 180 cm tall?</p>
<p>Here, μ = 175 cm (mean) and σ = 6 cm (standard deviation). We want to calculate P(170 ≤ X ≤ 180), where X follows a normal distribution.</p>
<p>To calculate this probability, we need to find the area under the normal curve between 170 and 180. This can be done using statistical tables or software.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>The scores on a standardized test are normally distributed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. What is the probability of scoring above 90 on the test?</p>
<p>Here, μ = 80 (mean) and σ = 10 (standard deviation). We want to calculate P(X > 90), where X follows a normal distribution.</p>
<p>To calculate this probability, we need to find the area under the normal curve to the right of 90. Again, this can be done using statistical tables or software.</p>
<p>The normal distribution is widely used in various fields of statistics, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and data analysis. It provides a convenient and powerful tool for modeling continuous random variables and making statistical inferences.</p>
