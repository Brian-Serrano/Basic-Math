<p>The addition rule of probabilities applies to both mutually exclusive and not mutually exclusive events. Let's discuss each case and provide examples for both scenarios:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Mutually Exclusive Events:</p>
        <p>Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (P(A and B)) is 0.</p>
        <p>In this case, the addition rule simplifies to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider drawing a card from a standard deck of 52 cards. Let event A be drawing a red card (hearts or diamonds), and event B be drawing a black card (clubs or spades). These events are mutually exclusive because a card cannot be both red and black at the same time. The probability of drawing a red card (P(A)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">26</span><span class="denominator">52</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>, and the probability of drawing a black card (P(B)) is also <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">26</span><span class="denominator">52</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>.</p>
        <p>Using the addition rule for mutually exclusive events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
            <li>P(A or B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> + <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span></li>
            <li>P(A or B) = 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the probability of drawing either a red card or a black card from a standard deck is 1 (or 100%).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Not Mutually Exclusive Events:</p>
        <p>Not mutually exclusive events are events that can occur together. In this case, the addition rule takes into account the overlap between the events by subtracting the probability of both events occurring simultaneously (P(A and B)).</p>
        <p>The general addition rule for not mutually exclusive events is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. Let event A be rolling an even number, and event B be rolling a number less than 4. These events are not mutually exclusive because, for example, the number 2 satisfies both events A and B. The probability of rolling an even number (P(A)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>, and the probability of rolling a number less than 4 (P(B)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span>. The probability of both events occurring simultaneously (P(A and B)) is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> since only the number 2 satisfies both conditions.</p>
        <p>Using the addition rule for not mutually exclusive events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</li>
            <li>P(A or B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> + <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> - <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span></li>
            <li>P(A or B) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the probability of rolling either an even number or a number less than 4 on a fair six-sided die is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These examples demonstrate how the addition rule of probabilities is applied to both mutually exclusive and not mutually exclusive events, accounting for the nature of the events and their overlap.</p>
