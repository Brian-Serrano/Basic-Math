<p>Number systems in mathematics refer to different ways of representing and organizing numbers. The most commonly used number systems are the decimal (base-10) system, binary (base-2) system, octal (base-8) system, and hexadecimal (base-16) system.</p>

    <li>
        <p>Decimal (Base-10) System:</p>
        <p>The decimal system is the number system most commonly used in everyday life. It consists of ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each digit's position in a decimal number represents a power of 10. For example, in the number 357, the digit 3 represents 3 hundreds (10<sup>2</sup>), the digit 5 represents 5 tens (10<sup>1</sup>), and the digit 7 represents 7 ones (10<sup>0</sup>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Binary (Base-2) System:</p>
        <p>The binary system is fundamental in computer science and digital electronics. It consists of two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit's position in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example, in the binary number 1011, the digit 1 represents 1 eight (2<sup>3</sup>), the digit 0 represents 0 fours (2<sup>2</sup>), the digit 1 represents 1 two (2<sup>1</sup>), and the digit 1 represents 1 one (2<sup>0</sup>). Binary numbers are commonly used to represent digital information, where 1 can denote "on" or "true," and 0 can denote "off" or "false."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Octal (Base-8) System:</p>
        <p>The octal system uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each digit's position in an octal number represents a power of 8. Octal numbers are used in some computer programming languages and have historical significance, particularly in early computing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Hexadecimal (Base-16) System:</p>
        <p>The hexadecimal system uses sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The additional six digits (A to F) are used to represent values from 10 to 15. Each digit's position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16. Hexadecimal numbers are widely used in computer programming, particularly in representing memory addresses and working with binary data.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these commonly used number systems, there are other systems, such as the base-60 system used for measuring time (seconds, minutes, hours) and the Roman numeral system, which uses letters to represent numbers.</p>
<p>Understanding different number systems is essential for various mathematical applications, computer science, digital electronics, and other fields where numbers are manipulated and represented in different ways.</p>
