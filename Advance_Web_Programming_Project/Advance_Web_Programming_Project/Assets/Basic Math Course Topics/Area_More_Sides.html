<p>The area of regular polygons can be calculated using different formulas depending on the polygon's shape. Let's discuss finding the area of a regular pentagon, regular hexagon, and regular octagon, and provide examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Regular Pentagon:</p>
        <p>A regular pentagon is a polygon with five equal sides and five equal angles. To find the area of a regular pentagon, you can use the following formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a regular pentagon = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">s<sup>2</sup> * sqrt(5 * (5 + 2 * sqrt(5)))</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>where "s" represents the length of one side.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a regular pentagon with a side length of 6 units. The area of this regular pentagon would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">6<sup>2</sup> * sqrt(5 * (5 + 2 * sqrt(5)))</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> ≈ 61.937 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the regular pentagon is approximately 61.937 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Regular Hexagon:</p>
        <p>A regular hexagon is a polygon with six equal sides and six equal angles. To find the area of a regular hexagon, you can use the following formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a regular hexagon = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3 * sqrt(3) * s<sup>2</sup></span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>where "s" represents the length of one side.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a regular hexagon with a side length of 8 units. The area of this regular hexagon would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3 * sqrt(3) * 8<sup>2</sup></span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = 96 * sqrt(3) ≈ 166.276 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the regular hexagon is approximately 166.276 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Regular Octagon:</p>
        <p>A regular octagon is a polygon with eight equal sides and eight equal angles. To find the area of a regular octagon, you can use the following formula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a regular octagon = 2 * (1 + sqrt(2)) * s<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>where "s" represents the length of one side.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a regular octagon with a side length of 10 units. The area of this regular octagon would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = 2 * (1 + sqrt(2)) * 10<sup>2</sup> = 200 * (1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ 568.579 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the regular octagon is approximately 568.579 square units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the area of regular polygons such as a regular pentagon, regular hexagon, and regular octagon. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
