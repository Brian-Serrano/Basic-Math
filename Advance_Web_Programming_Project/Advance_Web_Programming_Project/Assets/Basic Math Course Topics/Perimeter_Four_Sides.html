<p>The perimeter of a four-sided shape is the total length of its four sides. The formulas to find the perimeter of different four-sided shapes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Square:</p>
        <p>A square is a four-sided polygon with all sides of equal length. To find the perimeter of a square, you simply multiply the length of one side by 4.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's say we have a square with a side length of 5 units. The perimeter of this square would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 4 * 5 = 20 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the square is 20 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Rectangle:</p>
        <p>A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides of equal length. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you add the lengths of all four sides.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * (length + width)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 6 units. The perimeter of this rectangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 2 * (8 + 6) = 2 * 14 = 28 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 28 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Trapezoid:</p>
        <p>A trapezoid is a four-sided polygon with one pair of parallel sides. To find the perimeter of a trapezoid, you add the lengths of all four sides.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a trapezoid = side A + side B + side C + side D</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a trapezoid with side lengths of 6 units, 8 units, 10 units, and 12 units. The perimeter of this trapezoid would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 36 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 36 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Parallelogram:</p>
        <p>A parallelogram is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length. To find the perimeter of a parallelogram, you add the lengths of all four sides.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a parallelogram = side A + side B + side C + side D</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a parallelogram with side lengths of 7 units, 9 units, 7 units, and 9 units. The perimeter of this parallelogram would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 7 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 32 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the parallelogram is 32 units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the perimeter of four-sided shapes such as a square, rectangle, trapezoid, and parallelogram. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
