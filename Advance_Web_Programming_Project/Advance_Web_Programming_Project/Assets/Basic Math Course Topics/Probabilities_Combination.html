<p>In mathematics, combination refers to the selection of objects or events without considering their order. Combination probabilities are used to calculate the likelihood of selecting a particular group of objects from a given set without regard to the order in which they are chosen. The formula for calculating combination probabilities involves the total number of objects and the number of objects to be chosen. Let's discuss combination probabilities and provide examples:</p>
<p>The formula for combination is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C(n, r) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">n!</span><span class="denominator">r! * (n - r)!</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>where C(n, r) represents the number of combinations of r objects chosen from a set of n objects.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Consider a group of 10 people, and we want to calculate the probability of selecting a committee of 4 people from this group. The number of combinations of 4 people chosen from a set of 10 people is given by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C(10, 4) = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">10!</span><span class="denominator">4! * (10 - 4)!</span></span></span></li>
    <li>= <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">10!</span><span class="denominator">4! * 6!</span></span></span></li>
    <li>= <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">10 * 9 * 8 * 7</span><span class="denominator">4 * 3 * 2 * 1</span></span></span></li>
    <li>= 210</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there are 210 possible combinations of selecting a committee of 4 people from a group of 10.</p>
<p>Combination probabilities are often used in situations where the order of selection does not matter. For example, selecting a group of people for a committee, choosing a subset of items from a larger set, or forming a team from a pool of players. The formula for combinations helps calculate the total number of possibilities without considering the order of selection.</p>
