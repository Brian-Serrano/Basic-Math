<p>I'll discuss the conversion from decimal to the other three base systems: binary, octal, and hexadecimal.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Conversion from Decimal to Binary (Base-10 to Base-2):</p>
        <p>To convert a decimal number to binary, you repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and note down the remainders from each division. The binary representation is obtained by writing the remainders in reverse order.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's convert the decimal number 25 to binary.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Step 1: Divide 25 by 2:</p>
                <p>25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 2: Divide 12 by 2:</p>
                <p>12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 3: Divide 6 by 2:</p>
                <p>6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 4: Divide 3 by 2:</p>
                <p>3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 5: Divide 1 by 2:</p>
                <p>1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The remainders in reverse order are 11001, so the binary representation of 25 is 11001.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Conversion from Decimal to Octal (Base-10 to Base-8):</p>
        <p>To convert a decimal number to octal, you repeatedly divide the decimal number by 8 and note down the remainders from each division. The octal representation is obtained by writing the remainders in reverse order.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's convert the decimal number 63 to octal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Step 1: Divide 63 by 8:</p>
                <p>63 ÷ 8 = 7 remainder 7</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 2: Divide 7 by 8:</p>
                <p>7 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 7</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The remainders in reverse order are 77, so the octal representation of 63 is 77.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Conversion from Decimal to Hexadecimal (Base-10 to Base-16):</p>
        <p>To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, you repeatedly divide the decimal number by 16 and note down the remainders from each division. The hexadecimal representation is obtained by writing the remainders in reverse order, with any remainder greater than 9 represented by the corresponding letters A to F.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's convert the decimal number 157 to hexadecimal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Step 1: Divide 157 by 16:</p>
                <p>157 ÷ 16 = 9 remainder 13 (D in hexadecimal)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 2: Divide 9 by 16:</p>
                <p>9 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 9</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The remainders in reverse order are D9, so the hexadecimal representation of 157 is D9.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These examples illustrate how to convert decimal numbers to binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Understanding these conversions is essential in various computing fields, digital systems, and programming languages where different base systems are used.</p>
