<p>The area of a four-sided shape is a measure of the region enclosed by its four sides. The formulas to find the area of different four-sided shapes are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Square:</p>
        <p>A square is a four-sided polygon with all sides of equal length. To find the area of a square, you multiply the length of one side by itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a square = side length * side length = side length<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Let's say we have a square with a side length of 5 units. The area of this square would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = 5 * 5 = 25 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the square is 25 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Rectangle:</p>
        <p>A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides of equal length. To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply the length of one side (length) by the length of the adjacent side (width).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a rectangle = length * width</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 6 units. The area of this rectangle would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = 8 * 6 = 48 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the rectangle is 48 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Trapezoid:</p>
        <p>A trapezoid is a four-sided polygon with one pair of parallel sides. To find the area of a trapezoid, you multiply the average of the lengths of the parallel sides (base1 and base2) by the height (distance between the parallel sides).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a trapezoid = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">(base1 + base2) * height</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a trapezoid with base1 of 6 units, base2 of 10 units, and a height of 5 units. The area of this trapezoid would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">(6 + 10) * 5</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">16 * 5</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = 40 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the trapezoid is 40 square units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Parallelogram:</p>
        <p>A parallelogram is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length. To find the area of a parallelogram, you multiply the length of the base by the height.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area of a parallelogram = base * height</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a parallelogram with a base length of 7 units and a height of 9 units. The area of this parallelogram would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area = 7 * 9 = 63 square units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the area of the parallelogram is 63 square units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These formulas and examples can help you find the area of four-sided shapes such as a square, rectangle, trapezoid, and parallelogram. Remember to use the appropriate formula based on the given shape and its properties.</p>
