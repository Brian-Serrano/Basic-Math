<p>In mathematics, the perimeter of a circle refers to the distance around the outer boundary of the circle. It is also known as the circumference of the circle. The perimeter/circumference of a circle can be found using the formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C = 2πr</li>
</ul>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C represents the circumference or perimeter of the circle,</li>
    <li>π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and</li>
    <li>r is the radius of the circle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example that illustrates finding the perimeter of a circle:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Let's say we have a circle with a radius of 5 centimeters. To find the perimeter (circumference) of this circle, we can use the formula:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C = 2πr</li>
</ul>
<p>Substituting the given value, we have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C = 2 * 3.14159 * 5</li>
    <li>≈ 31.4159 centimeters</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle with a radius of 5 centimeters is approximately 31.4159 centimeters.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its radius. Doubling the radius will result in doubling the circumference. Similarly, if you know the diameter of the circle (which is twice the radius), you can use the formula C = πd to find the perimeter.</p>
<p>The perimeter (circumference) of a circle is an important concept in geometry and is used in various calculations involving circles, such as finding the area of a circle or solving problems related to circular objects.</p>
