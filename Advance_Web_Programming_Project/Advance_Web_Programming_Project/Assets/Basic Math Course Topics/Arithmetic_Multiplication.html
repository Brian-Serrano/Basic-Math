<p>Multiplication is a basic arithmetic operation in mathematics that involves combining two or more numbers to find their product. The symbol used to represent multiplication is "x" or "*", or sometimes implied by juxtaposing numbers.</p>
<p>To perform multiplication, you multiply the numbers together, following the basic rules of arithmetic. For example, to multiply 2 and 3, you would write:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 x 3 = 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more examples of multiplication:</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 x 6 = 24</li>
    <li>8 x 9 = 72</li>
    <li>3 x 5 = 15</li>
    <li>7 x 2 = 14</li>
    <li>10 x 4 = 40</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiplication can also be used to calculate the area of rectangles and squares. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. For example, if a rectangle has a length of 5 units and a width of 3 units, the area is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5 x 3 = 15 square units</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiplication can also be used to calculate the total cost of multiple items of the same price or the total quantity when items are repeated. For example, if a book costs $10 and you want to buy 5 books, the total cost would be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$10 x 5 = $50</li>
</ul>
<p>When multiplying fractions, you multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator, and the denominators together to get the new denominator. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> x <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1 x 3</span><span class="denominator">2 x 4</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">8</span></span></span></li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span> x <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="denominator">6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2 x 5</span><span class="denominator">3 x 6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">10</span><span class="denominator">18</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">5</span><span class="denominator">9</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>When multiplying decimals, you multiply the numbers as you would with whole numbers and then count the total number of decimal places in the factors and place the decimal point accordingly in the product. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3.5 x 1.2 = 4.2</li>
    <li>0.75 x 0.5 = 0.375</li>
    <li>2.5 x 0.4 = 1.0</li>
</ul>
