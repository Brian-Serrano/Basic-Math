<p>In statistics, measures of variability are used to describe the spread or dispersion of a dataset. They provide information about how the data points are spread out from the central tendency measures. The three common measures of variability are the range, variance, and standard deviation. Let's discuss each measure and provide examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Range:</p>
        <p>The range is the simplest measure of variability and is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5</p>
        <p>Range = Largest value - Smallest value = 12 - 4 = 8</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Variance:</p>
        <p>The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a measure of the spread around the mean.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5</li>
            <li>Step 1: Calculate the mean (discussed earlier): Mean = 7.4</li>
            <li>Step 2: Calculate the squared deviation of each data point from the mean:
                <ul>
                    <li>(4 - 7.4)<sup>2</sup> = 11.56</li>
                    <li>(7 - 7.4)<sup>2</sup> = 0.16</li>
                    <li>(9 - 7.4)<sup>2</sup> = 2.56</li>
                    <li>(12 - 7.4)<sup>2</sup> = 21.16</li>
                    <li>(5 - 7.4)<sup>2</sup> = 5.76</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Step 3: Calculate the average of the squared deviations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Variance = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">11.56 + 0.16 + 2.56 + 21.16 + 5.76</span><span class="denominator">5</span></span></span> = 8.04</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Standard Deviation:</p>
        <p>The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average amount of deviation or dispersion from the mean.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Using the previous dataset and variance:</p>
        <p>Variance = 8.04</p>
        <p>Standard Deviation = √(8.04) ≈ 2.84</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Measures of variability provide insights into the spread or dispersion of the data points around the central tendency measures. They help in understanding the variability and distribution characteristics of the dataset. The choice of the appropriate measure depends on the specific context and the nature of the data.</p>
