<p>In statistics, measures of central tendency are used to describe the center or average of a dataset. They provide a single value that represents the typical or central value of the data. The three common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Let's discuss each measure and provide examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Mean:</p>
        <p>The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing it by the total number of values.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5</p>
        <p>Mean = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4 + 7 + 9 + 12 + 5</span><span class="denominator">5</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">37</span><span class="denominator">5</span></span></span> = 7.4</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Median:</p>
        <p>The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5</p>
        <p>Arrange in ascending order: 4, 5, 7, 9, 12</p>
        <p>Median = 7</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5, 15</p>
        <p>Arrange in ascending order: 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15</p>
        <p>Median = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">7 + 9</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> = 8</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Mode:</p>
        <p>The mode is the value or values that appear most frequently in the dataset. There can be no mode (when all values are distinct), a single mode, or multiple modes.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5, 7</p>
        <p>Mode = 7 (appears twice)</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 12, 5</p>
        <p>No mode (all values are distinct)</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Measures of central tendency provide a summary of the typical or central value in a dataset. They help in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data. It's important to choose the appropriate measure based on the nature and characteristics of the dataset.</p>
