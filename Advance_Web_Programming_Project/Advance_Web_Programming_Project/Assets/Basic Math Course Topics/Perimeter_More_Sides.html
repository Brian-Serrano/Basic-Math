<p>The perimeter of regular polygons can be found by multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides. Let's discuss finding the perimeter of a regular pentagon, regular hexagon, and regular octagon, and provide examples:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Regular Pentagon:</p>
        <p>A regular pentagon is a polygon with five equal sides. To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, you multiply the length of one side by 5.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a regular pentagon = 5 * side length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a regular pentagon with a side length of 6 units. The perimeter of this regular pentagon would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 5 * 6 = 30 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the regular pentagon is 30 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Regular Hexagon:</p>
        <p>A regular hexagon is a polygon with six equal sides. To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon, you multiply the length of one side by 6.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a regular hexagon = 6 * side length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Consider a regular hexagon with a side length of 8 units. The perimeter of this regular hexagon would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 6 * 8 = 48 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 48 units.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Regular Octagon:</p>
        <p>A regular octagon is a polygon with eight equal sides. To find the perimeter of a regular octagon, you multiply the length of one side by 8.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter of a regular octagon = 8 * side length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Suppose we have a regular octagon with a side length of 10 units. The perimeter of this regular octagon would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perimeter = 8 * 10 = 80 units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the perimeter of the regular octagon is 80 units.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The perimeter of regular polygons can be easily calculated by multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides. This formula applies to regular pentagons, regular hexagons, and regular octagons, as well as other regular polygons.</p>
