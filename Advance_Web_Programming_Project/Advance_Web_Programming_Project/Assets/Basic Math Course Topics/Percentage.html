<p>The term "percentage" was adapted from the Latin word "per centum", which means "by the hundred". Percentages are fractions with 100 as the denominator. In other words, it is the relation between part and whole where the value of "whole" is always taken as 100.</p>
<p>For example, if the marks of a student in math are 15 out of 50 then the corresponding percentage can be calculated by expressing "marks obtained" as a fraction of "total marks" and multiplying the result by 100. i.e., percentage of marks = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">15</span><span class="denominator">50</span></span></span> × 100 = 30%.

<p>What is the Percentage?</p>
<p>The percentage is a fraction or a ratio in which the value of the whole (denominator) is always 100. For example, if Sam scored 30% marks in his math test, it means that he scored 30 marks out of 100. It is written as <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">30</span><span class="denominator">100</span></span></span> in the fraction form and 30:100 in terms of ratio. Here "%" is the symbol of percentage and is read as "percent" or "percentage". This percent symbol can always be replaced with "divided by 100" to convert it into a fraction or decimal equivalent.</p>
<p>Examples of Percentage</p>
<ul>
    <li>10% = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">10</span><span class="denominator">100</span></span></span>  = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">10</span></span></span> or 0.1</li>
    <li>25% = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">25</span><span class="denominator">100</span></span></span>  = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> or 0.25</li>
    <li>12.5% = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">12.5</span><span class="denominator">100</span></span></span>  = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">8</span></span></span> or 0.125</li>
    <li>50% = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">50</span><span class="denominator">100</span></span></span>  = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="denominator">2</span></span></span> or 0.5</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculating Percentage</p>
<p>Calculating percentage means finding the share out of the whole, in terms of 100. There are two ways to calculate percentage:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>By changing the denominator of the fraction to 100: In this method, we just find the equivalent fraction of a given fraction such that the resultant denominator is 100. Then the numerator itself is the percentage. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span></span> × <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">16</span><span class="denominator">100</span></span></span> = 16%</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>By using the unitary method: In this method, we just multiply the fraction by 100 to get the percentage. For example, the percentage that corresponds to the fraction <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span></span> is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">4</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span></span> × 100 = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">400</span><span class="denominator">25</span></span></span> = 16%</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>It should be noted that the first method for calculating the percentage is not suggested in situations where the denominator is not a factor of 100. In such cases, we use the unitary method. Let's see how to find the percentage using the two methods given above in detail.</p>
<p>Finding Percentage When the Total is 100</p>
<p>When we have two or more values that add up to 100, the percentage of those individual values to the total value is that number itself. For example, Sally bought tiles of three different colors for her house. The details of the purchase are given in the following table.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Colour</th>
            <th>Number of Tiles</th>
            <th>Rate per Hundred</th>
            <th>Fraction</th>
            <th>Percentage</th>
            <th>Read as</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Yellow</th>
            <td>39</td>
            <td>39</td>
            <td>39/100</td>
            <td>39%</td>
            <td>39 percent</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Green</th>
            <td>26</td>
            <td>26</td>
            <td>26/100</td>
            <td>26%</td>
            <td>26 percent</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Red</th>
            <td>35</td>
            <td>35</td>
            <td>35/100</td>
            <td>35%</td>
            <td>35 percent</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>Percentage Formula</p>
<p>The percentage formula is used to find the share of a whole in terms of 100. Using this formula, you can represent a number as a fraction of 100. If you observe carefully, all three ways to get the percentage shown above can be easily calculated by using the formula given below:</p>
<p>Percentage = (Value/Total Value)×100</p>
<p>Example: In a class of 40 children, 10 are girls. Then what is the percentage of girls?</p>
<p>Solution: Here, the number of girls = 10.</p>
<p>The total number of children = 40.</p>
<p>By the percentage formula,</p>
<p>the percentage of girls = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">10</span><span class="denominator">40</span></span></span> × 100 = 25%.</p>
