<p>Simplifying fractions involves reducing a fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This process ensures that the fraction is expressed with the smallest possible whole numbers.</p>
<p>Here's the step-by-step process for simplifying fractions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Find the GCD of the numerator and denominator.
        <ul>
            <li>The GCD is the largest number that divides both the numerator and denominator without leaving a remainder.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.
        <ul>
            <li>Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If possible, further simplify the fraction.
        <ul>
            <li>If the numerator and denominator have common factors, continue dividing by their GCD until no common factors remain.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of simplifying fractions:</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Consider the fraction <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">12</span><span class="denominator">18</span></span></span>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Find the GCD of 12 and 18. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The largest number that divides both 12 and 18 is 6.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Divide both the numerator and denominator by 6.</li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">12</span><span class="denominator">18</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">12 ÷ 6</span><span class="denominator">18 ÷ 6</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the simplified form of <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">12</span><span class="denominator">18</span></span></span> is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Let's simplify the fraction <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">16</span><span class="denominator">24</span></span></span>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Find the GCD of 16 and 24. The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The largest number that divides both 16 and 24 is 8.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Divide both the numerator and denominator by 8.</li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">16</span><span class="denominator">24</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">16 ÷ 8</span><span class="denominator">24 ÷ 8</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the simplified form of <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">16</span><span class="denominator">24</span></span></span> is also <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">2</span><span class="denominator">3</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Example 3:</p>
<p>Consider the fraction <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">15</span><span class="denominator">20</span></span></span>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1: Find the GCD of 15 and 20. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. The largest number that divides both 15 and 20 is 5.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Divide both the numerator and denominator by 5.</li>
    <li><span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">15</span><span class="denominator">20</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">15 ÷ 5</span><span class="denominator">20 ÷ 5</span></span></span> = <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the simplified form of <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">15</span><span class="denominator">20</span></span></span> is <span class="fraction-container"><span class="fraction"><span class="numerator">3</span><span class="denominator">4</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate the process of simplifying fractions by finding the GCD and dividing the numerator and denominator by it. By simplifying fractions, you express them in their most reduced form.</p>
