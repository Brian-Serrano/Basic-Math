<p>In statistics, a probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a given set of possible outcomes. It provides a mathematical representation of the probabilities associated with each possible value or range of values in a random variable. There are several types of probability distributions, including discrete and continuous distributions. Let's discuss a few common probability distributions and provide examples:</p>

    <li>
        <p>Discrete Probability Distributions:</p>
        <p>Discrete probability distributions are used when the random variable can take on a finite or countable number of distinct values. Examples of discrete probability distributions include the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Binomial Distribution:</p>
                <p>The binomial distribution describes the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is characterized by two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p) in each trial.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Tossing a fair coin 10 times and counting the number of heads. Here, n = 10 (number of trials) and p = 0.5 (probability of getting a head in each trial).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Poisson Distribution:</p>
                <p>The Poisson distribution models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space. It is characterized by a single parameter, λ (lambda), which represents the average rate of occurrence of the events.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>The number of customers arriving at a store per hour follows a Poisson distribution with an average rate of 4 customers per hour (λ = 4).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Continuous Probability Distributions:</p>
        <p>Continuous probability distributions are used when the random variable can take on any value within a specified range. Examples of continuous probability distributions include the normal distribution and the exponential distribution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Normal Distribution:</p>
                <p>The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a symmetrical bell-shaped curve that is widely used in statistics. It is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>The heights of adult males in a population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 175 cm (μ = 175) and a standard deviation of 6 cm (σ = 6).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Exponential Distribution:</p>
                <p>The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>The time it takes for a customer to be served at a restaurant follows an exponential distribution with an average rate of 0.5 customers per minute.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of probability distributions commonly used in statistics. Probability distributions play a crucial role in modeling and analyzing random phenomena and are fundamental tools in statistical inference and decision-making.</p>
